# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-ML-Project-1-

The Sonar_dataset.csv is converted to a dataframe by the use of pandas and then that data set is processed by Data Processing .
After the data processing , that dataset undergoes train_test_split model to train the data for further prediction by the help of Logistic regression
Accuaracy of Trained data = 0.8342245989304813 ( 83 % )
Accuaracy of Testing data = 0.7619047619047619 ( 76 % )
Finally the SONAR Rock vs Mine predection is done by the input_data ( collected data for prediction) and trained model
